INTRO                                                          *dyslexic-intro*

|dyslexic| helps you find mistyped text by searching for |word| permutations.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                          *dyslexic-usage*

While the cursor is over a /known and correct/ word, pressing the
|dyslexic-map| key will search for permutations of that word.  If there are
matches, the |location-window| will open to display them.  From there, you can
review the matches to see if any of them are incorrect.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                    *dyslexic-commands*

							   *:DyslexicTracking*
:DyslexicTracking		Toggles cursor tracking to highlight
				permutations while moving the cursor.  The
				|location-list| will not be opened while this
				is enabled.  Calling this command again will
				turn cursor tracking off.  Pressing the
				|dyslexic-map| key will search for
				permutations and disable cursor tracking.

								*:DyslexicOff*
:DyslexicOff			Turns off the highlighting and cursor
				tracking.


==============================================================================
CONFIG                                                        *dyslexic-config*

							      *g:dyslexic_map*
								*dyslexic-map*
g:dyslexic_map			Set the key map to toggle permutation
				highlighting.  Setting this to an empty value
				will disable mapping.

				If you want to set the map yourself, will need
				to map `<Plug>(Dyslexic)` to a key.

				Default: `<localleader>*`


==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHT                                                  *dyslexic-highlight*

								 *hl-Dyslexic*
Dyslexic			This is the highlight group for matching
				permutations.  It is recommended that you set
				this to something different from the
				|hl-Search| group.

				Default: `ctermfg=0`
					 `ctermbg=6`
					 `guifg=#000000`
					 `guibg=#00ffff`


==============================================================================
NOTES                                                          *dyslexic-notes*

If the cursor is over a mistyped word, it will match the other correctly
spelled words.  If I (or you) am ever bored enough to, Levenshtein Distance
and tf-idf scoring might be an interesting way to rank which words are likely
to be the mistyped variants.

The pattern that's created is not a fuzzy search.  It searches for transposed
characters, single character substitution, and 1-2 character additions between
each character.

Since the generated pattern covers different variations of the word, a long
word can potentially create a very large pattern.  I don't know if there's
limitations to the size of a pattern in Vim or how a very large pattern will
affect performance.  Keep this in mind and make sure your code is in a safe
state before searching for permutations on those crazy long Java class names.
